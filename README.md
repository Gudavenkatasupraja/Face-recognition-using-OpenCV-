# Face-recognition-using-OpenCV-
Face recognition using OpenCV involves detecting faces, aligning them, extracting features, and using a recognition model to identify individuals. OpenCV provides tools for each step, enabling the creation of robust face recognition systems with applications in security, surveillance, and biometrics.
# Real-Time Face Detection with OpenCV
Step 1: Pre-Requisites
First, letâ€™s go ahead and import the OpenCV library and load the Haar Cascade model just like we did in the previous section.
